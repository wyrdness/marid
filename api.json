      "full": "Marid are the most powerful and rarest type of djinn in Islamic theology and Arabian folklore. Created from smokeless fire like all djinn, Marid possess immense supernatural powers including shape-shifting, magic mastery, reality manipulation, and wish-granting abilities. In Islamic tradition, they have free will and can be good, evil, or neutral. Western folklore, particularly through the Arabian Nights tales, popularized the image of Marid as wish-granting genies bound to lamps or bottles, though this is a later cultural adaptation. Even King Solomon, who commanded djinn, reportedly struggled to control Marid due to their exceptional power and prideful nature."
